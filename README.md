# Development and Validation of Machine Learning Models to Predict MDRO Colonization or Infection on ICU Admission by Using Electronic Health Record Data

Welcome to the GitHub repository of our research project **"Development and Validation of Machine Learning Models to Predict MDRO Colonization or Infection on ICU Admission by Using Electronic Health Record Data"**.

## Overview

This repository contains the data processing and machine learning Jupyter notebooks used in our study to develop and validate models. These models are designed to predict Multi-Drug Resistant Organism (MDRO) colonization or infection at the time of ICU admission using Electronic Health Record (EHR) data.

## Repository Structure

- `mimiciv/`: Code for mimiciv datasets.
- `plagh_icu/`: Code for plagh_icu datasets.
